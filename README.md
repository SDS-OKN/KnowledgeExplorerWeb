# KnowledgeExplorerWeb
Web prototype for Knowledge Explorer
The purpose of this application was to demonstrate querying across ontologies.   
You will need to install the server side components from the KBServices folder  and have either Allegrograph or similar server.
The key elements left would be to build an installer, continue the integration of the different views, federated searching, connect the NLP to a more robust client, and to remove any ESRI linkage.
